========================================================================
DAY 1:
WHY DEVOPS: To deliver application very Speedily.
SDLC: software development lifecycle.
DEPLOYMENT: Process of installing application in server.
PLAN-->CODE-->BUILD-->TEST-->DEPLOY-->OPERATE-->MONITOR
DEVELOPMENT TEAM           |  OPERATION TEAM

BEFORE DEVOPS = DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION TEAM ARE DIFFERENT.
AFTER DEVOPS  = DEVELOPMENT TEAM + OPERATION TEAM
"DEVEPS IS NOT A TOOL, TECHNOLOGY OR FRAMEWORK"
DEVOPS IS METHODOLOGY WHERE DEVELOPMENT TEAM AND OPERATION TEAM WORK TOGETHER TO DEPLOY APPLICATION SPEEDLY.
end to end engineering.
==========================================================================
DAY 2:
SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES:
1. ONE-TIER 
2. TWO-TIER
3. THREE-TIER
4. N-TIER

TIER: SERVER: LAYER

SERVER: servers provide services to the end user.
1. web server: 
2. app server:
3. DB server:


WEB SERVER:
It is also called as the presentation layer.
To show the application.
who works: UI/UX developers
what they use: web technologies
ex: HTML, CSS, JS

APP SERVER: 
To use the application.
also called the logic layer
who work: backend developers
what they use: programming
ex: java, python, c, c++, .NET, go --------

DB SERVER:
It also called as db layer.
To store & retrieve data.
who work: db admins
what they use: db languages
ex: sql, oracle, postgres, arango ----

ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE: STANDALONE APPLICATION
THE APP WILL WORK ON A LOCAL LAPTOP.
ALL LAYERS WILL BE ON LOCALLY.
IT WILL NOT REQ ANY INTERNET CONNECTION.
EX: VLC MEDIA PLAYER


TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE: CLIENT-SERVER APPLICATION
THE APP WILL WORK ON A LOCAL LAPTOP.
LOCAL:PRESENTATION, LOGIC    DB: INTERNET 
IT WILL REQ ANY INTERNET CONNECTION.
EX: BANKING APPLICATIONS

THREE-TIER: WEB APPLICATION (REALTIME)
APPLICATION NO NEED TO BE ON LOCAL.
EVERYTHING WE CAN USE FROM THE INTERNET.
EX: WHATSAPP, YOUTUBE, INSTA -----
==========================================================
DAY 3:

AGENDA: CREATE A WEBSERVER AND SHOW THE LIVE ENV 
SERVER: SERVER SERVS THE SERVICES TO END USER. || RESPONSE TO THE REQUEST OF CLIENT || REQUEST <--> RESPONSE PRINCIPLE.

WEB SERVER: TO SHOW THE APPLICATION

TO CREATE SERVER WE NEED TO HAVE CLOUD ACCOUNT.
AWS: EC2 INSTANCES = ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD

TO CREATE EC2 WE NEED TO PERFORM 7 STEPS:

SERVER = COMPUTER
1. TAGS = NAME
2. AMI = OS, SOFTWARE PACKAGES
3. INSTANCE_TYPE = CPU & RAM
4. KEY_PAIR = LOGIN (public=aws, private=user)
5. NETWORK = VPC, SECURITY GROUPS (port numbers=0-65535)
6. STORAGE = 8 GB - 16 TB (200 GB will be enough on most of the cases in real time)
7. SUMMARY = TO REVIEW 

SSH= SECURE SHELL (22) - TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS
